This Is a barebones demo of a renderer I have written for rendering voxel grids using path tracing. It works by using the DDA line algorithm to march rays through a uniform voxel grid. 
In the configuration shown here, the renderer is using path tracing to acheive complex lighting effects such as reflection, soft shadows, and global illumination/ bounce lighting.
The renderer can run in any modern browser on a computer with a decent GPU (gtx 1060 or better). 

This project is hosted here if You would like to see it (BE WARNED the 1st time shader compilation can take up to 30 seconds and I have only tested this on chrome with Nvidia GPUs): https://replit.com/@JuliusVA/voxel-renderer
